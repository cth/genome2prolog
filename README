This program reads some genbank data files and converts the
data (or selected parts of it) to Prolog facts.


The program expects to be run with following arguments:

genome2prolog inputdir outputfile actions [options]

actions is a space separated list of actions from the set:
genome, genes, nucleotides, nongenes, checkdata, gene_positions.

The actions will be run in the order specified.

options is a space separate set of option keys and values, 
each with the syntax: key=value

Supported actions include: 

range=To-From	Where To and From denote a range of nucleotide positions (inclusive)
